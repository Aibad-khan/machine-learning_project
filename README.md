# Multi Label CAPEC Classification Of Web Attacks

 In this project we are using machine learning tehniques specifically multi label classification to classify different types of web attacks under attack categories like(SQL 
 injection,Path Traversal,Protocol Manipulation...etc,using different combination of algorithms and compare their results based on metrics parameters like 
 accuracy,ROC_AUC,jaccard similarity...,etc
 
 we have taken dataset from a research paper which was published in May,2022 by a group of researchers.It is known as SRBH-2020 dataset
 
 Lastly we would like to express our sincere gratitude to(Tomás Sureda Riera,Juan-Ramón Bermejo Higuera,Javier Bermejo Higuera,José-Javier Martínez Herraiz,Juan-Antonio 
 Sicilia Montalvo) for allowing us to use their dataset.
 feel free to point out bugs,i am sure will be able to look it😊😊
