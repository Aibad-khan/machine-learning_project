# Multi Label CAPEC Classification Of Web Attacks
# In this project we are using machine learning tehniques specifically multi label classification to classify different types of web attacks under attack categories like(SQL injection,Path Traversal,Protocol Manipulation...etc,using different combination of algorithms and compare their results based on metrics parameters like accuracy,ROC_AUC,jaccard similarity...,etc
# we have taken dataset from a research paper which was published in May,2022 by a group of researchers.
# Lastly we would like to express our sincere gratitude to(Tomás Sureda Riera,Juan-Ramón Bermejo Higuera,Javier Bermejo Higuera,José-Javier Martínez Herraiz,Juan-Antonio Sicilia Montalvo ) for allowing us to use their dataset.
